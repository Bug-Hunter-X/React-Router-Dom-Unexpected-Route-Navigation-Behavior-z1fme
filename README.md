# React Router Dom Unexpected Route Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom where route navigation behaves unexpectedly.  Routes are defined correctly, yet navigation fails silently or produces incorrect renders. This issue is often subtle and difficult to debug. The bug.js file contains the problematic code; bugSolution.js provides the fix.

## Problem Description

The application uses React Router Dom v6 for navigation.  Despite properly defined routes, attempts to navigate between routes sometimes fail to render the expected component. No errors are thrown, leading to confusion and difficulty in debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the route definitions in the `App` component, ensuring there are no typos or conflicting paths.  In some cases, issues can arise from improper use of `useParams` or other React Router hooks within the components themselves.  The bugSolution.js file provides corrected code.
